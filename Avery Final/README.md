The app's main feature is to return a list of tweets that include the user's desired hashtag and location. The app also emails the user the list of tweets with the chosen hashtag.The first step is to register for an account with an email and password. After registering, the user will log in with their email and password. After logging in the user is asked to enter a hashtag and location. This step will allow the app to search for tweets in a certain area that have used the hashtag. I have used both Postico and Postgres to run the application. The application will also keep a record of the hashtags a user has searched associated with their inputed email.
